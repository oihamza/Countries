[Countries - How many do you know?](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/countries-how-many-do-you-know/id899400115)

How well do you know the world?

Enter any Country’s name and watch the map clearly highlight. Pan around the interactive map and enter as many countries you can name!

Once your timer runs out, find out how much of a genius (or not) you really are. Should you ‘Stay in school’, or will ‘NASA need you’?


This game accepts answers in:
• English
• French
• The local language of each Country.

Rules:
|>Enter the Country’s name and it will go on the map straight away
|> Easily tap just once on the map to zoom in and zoom out.
|>Abbreviations and slight misspellings are accepted for most countries
|> Answers have to be a sovereign nation, so answers like United Kingdom are accepted, but not England, Scotland, etc.
|> ‘Extra Credit’ Countries and territories are given to boost possible points earned
