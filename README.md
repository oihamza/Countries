How well do you know the world?

Enter any Country’s name and watch the map clearly highlight. Pan around the interactive map and enter as many countries you can name!

Once your timer runs out, find out how much of a genius (or not) you really are. Should you ‘Stay in school’, or will ‘NASA need you’?
